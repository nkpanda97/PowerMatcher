# PowerMatcher
This is a MATLAB simulation of the implementation of Power Matcher in LV  Grid for Residential Consumers
To run the Power Matcher simulation follow the following instruction
1. Download the Zip folder named ‘PowerMatcher_LV_Residential_2020_V1.zip’
2. After unzipping the folder, go to the folder and find the file named- ‘main_application.m’
3. Open the file -‘main_application.m’ in MATLAB
4. Make sure the path of the folder is added in the path of the MATLAB. Run the file pressing the play button in the editor tab
6. You could see the program running and two dynamic graphs displaying
7. At the end of the simulation there will be in total four graphs
